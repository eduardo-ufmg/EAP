  \note{Result is similar to visual prediction <br>
  <br><br>
  We are also prediting points in the space <br>
  Predict some points without samples <br>
  Let's do that for the entire grid}

\subsection{Decision boundary}

\begin{frame}{Decision boundary}
  \begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \small{\caption{Decision boundary of the nearest neighbor classifier}}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../results/dbnn.png}
  \end{figure}

  \note{Some regions seem wrongly labeled <br>
  Why? <br>
  Misclassification in training <br>
  Some points are closer to the misclassified sample <br>
  How to improve it?}
