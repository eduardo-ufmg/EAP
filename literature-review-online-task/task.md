# Literature Review Online Task

1. The preparation of a literature review involves three main steps: finding relevant literature, reading, and writing the review. The first two steps often overlap, as abstracts may not always provide enough information, requiring deeper reading to assess relevance.

2. Your literature review should be concise unless your goal is to rewrite the literature or demonstrate extensive reading. In most cases, a more focused and succinct text is preferable.

3. It is rarely necessary to include all previous research related to your topic. Most reviews focus on the most recent publications, while others may target a specific time span, researcher type, or geographic location.

4. You can safely ignore literature that is not directly related to your topic.

5. The literature review is important because it shows that your findings, theory, or analysis contribute to a cumulative process.

7. It is expected that a literature review discusses problems or controversies within its subject area.

8. A literature review may be organized in any order that presents the information clearly.

10. While recent publications are often more relevant, older works may also contribute valuable insights to the literature review.

11. Your literature review should help reveal gaps in the existing body of research.
